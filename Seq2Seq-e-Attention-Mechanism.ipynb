\"memória\" do input).\n","Decoder: Lê esse vetor e gera a saída palavra por palavra.\n","\n","👉 Usado em: tradução automática, chatbots, sumarização de texto, legendagem de vídeo.\n","\n","✅ Problema da arquitetura clássica\n","O vetor de contexto gerado pelo encoder tem tamanho fixo.\n","Se a sequência for muito longa, o decoder perde informações.\n","\n","⭐ Attention Mechanism - A Solução\n","O Attention foi criado para resolver esse gargalo.\n","\n","📌 Como funciona?\n","O decoder não depende mais só do vetor fixo;\n","Ele \"olha\" para cada palavra da entrada e decide o que é mais importante a cada passo;\n","Calcula pesos (α) para cada palavra da entrada.\n","\n","💡 Exemplo: Na tradução de \"O menino comeu a maçã\", ao gerar \"apple\", o Attention vai focar mais em \"maçã\" do que no restante.\n","'''\n","\n","\n","'''\n","✅ Fórmula Simplificada do Attention:\n","`Attention(Q, K, V) = Softmax(Q * K.T / sqrt(d_k)) * V`\n","\n","Onde:\n","Q (Query): Vetor da palavra atual que

ever make you angry?\",\"2310\":\"sometimes.\",\"2311\":\"what does she do?\",\"2312\":\"just yesterday, i told her i wouldn't trade her for all the money in the world.\",\"2313\":\"that was a nice thing to say.\",\"2314\":\"that's what i thought.\",\"2315\":\"what did she say?\",\"2316\":\"she laughed! she didn't believe me.\",\"2317\":\"that wasn't very nice of her.\",\"2318\":\"she said that

that.\",\"2370\":\"why not?\",\"2371\":\"they will drop the new steak on the floor, step on it, and then spit on it.\",\"2372\":\"you're crazy.\",\"2373\":\"then the waiter will give you a big smile as he brings you the new steak.\",\"2374\":\"where do you get these crazy ideas?\",\"2375\":\"let's leave.\",\"2376\":\"but we just got here.\",\"2377\":\"did you see the waiter's hands?\",\"2378\":\"no.\",\"2379\":\"he had dirty fingernails.\",\"2380\":\"really?\",\"2381\":\"his nails were black!\",\"2382\":\"that's disgusting.\",\"2383\":\"and he poured water into our

the bathroom.\",\"2405\":\"i'm going to just hope that the bathroom is clean.\",\"2406\":\"you're not going to examine it before we order dinner?\",\"2407\":\"no, i'd rather not find out that it's

idea.\",\"2415\":\"maybe they'll give us free drinks for waiting so long.\",\"2416\":\"maybe he'll send us our waiter immediately.\",\"2417\":\"every time we eat out, it's an adventure.\",\"2418\":\"last time, we got seats next to the kitchen.\",\"2419\":\"is this table okay?\",\"2420\":\"no, it's too close to the kitchen door.\",\"2421\":\"how about this

the ground.\",\"2456\":\"you do this 18 times, because there are 18 holes.\",\"2457\":\"what's the point?\",\"2458\":\"how can it be fun?\",\"2459\":\"they pay money to play this silly

tiger.\",\"2497\":\"why is that?\",\"2498\":\"because he likes to scuba dive.\",\"2499\":\"what's wrong with that?\",\"2500\":\"it can be dangerous.\",\"2501\":\"you mean he could drown.\",\"2502\":\"he shouldn't scuba dive until he retires.\",\"2503\":\"but he dives to relax.\",\"2504\":\"he might relax, but it makes me nervous.\",\"2505\":\"did you watch that golf

problem.\",\"2563\":\"he said he wasn't using drugs.\",\"2564\":\"he apologized to the fans.\",\"2565\":\"the league suspended him for 50 games.\",\"2566\":\"that will cost him some money.\",\"2567\":\"yes, about $7 million.\",\"2568\":\"that will teach him a good lesson.\",\"2569\":\"he probably won't use drugs anymore.\",\"2570\":\"but it won't stop other players from using drugs.\",\"2571\":\"why is there so much crime?\",\"2572\":\"because parents don't teach their kids right from wrong.\",\"2573\":\"is that it?\",\"2574\":\"also, there aren't enough

he's made a few changes.\",\"3409\":\"like what?\",\"3410\":\"i think he closed the bowling alley in the white house.\",\"3411\":\"oh, yeah. he's changing it to a basketball court.\",\"3412\":\"who's paying for that?\",\"3413\":\"i think we are!\",\"3414\":\"well, that's okay, as long as it helps him relax and think more clearly.\",\"3415\":\"yes, we need a relaxed president who thinks

election.\",\"3472\":\"i see that former president bush is at a conference.\",\"3473\":\"yes. he's telling jokes about his eight years as president.\",\"3474\":\"yes, those eight years were a lot of fun for everyone.\",\"3475\":\"only 4,000 american soldiers were killed overseas.\",\"3476\":\"not to mention 40,000 wounded soldiers.\",\"3477\":\"but bush visited some of them in the hospital

what it's like to be super-smart?\",\"1493\":\"it must be very lonely.\",\"1494\":\"why's that?\",\"1495\":\"because if you're super-smart, no one understands what you're saying.\",\"1496\":\"nothing

cigarette.\",\"2327\":\"you don't need a good nose for that\\u00c2\\u2014cigarettes stink.\",\"2328\":\"but when i sneak just one cigarette in the morning, she can smell it that evening!\",\"2329\":\"boy, that is a good nose.\",\"2330\":\"i told her she should apply for a job at customs.\",\"2331\":\"that sounds like fun.\",\"2332\":\"where do you want to go?\",\"2333\":\"let

it?\",\"2343\":\"yes, but it isn't a fast-food restaurant, is it?\",\"2344\":\"it's the slowest hamburger in town.\",\"2345\":\"that's because they cook it while you wait.\",\"2346\":\"yes. that's why it's also the best hamburger in town.\",\"2347\":\"a great burger and great service.\",\"2348\":\"yes, the workers are very polite.\",\"2349\":\"and they're clean.\",\"2350\":\"i've been coming here for years.\",\"2351\":\"me too.\",\"2352\":\"excuse me. they just called my number.\",\"2353\":\"thank you.\",\"2354\":\"what kind of soup was that?\",\"2355\":\"it was tomato soup.\",\"2356\":\"that

toast.\",\"2361\":\"and the pickles were great, too.\",\"2362\":\"tomorrow we'll have rice and fish for lunch.\",\"2363\":\"i can't wait.\",\"2364\":\"what's the matter?\",\"2365\":\"this steak has too much fat.\",\"2366\":\"what do you want the waiter to do?\",\"2367\":\"bring me a better steak.\",\"2368\":\"i wouldn't do that.\",\"2369\":\"why not?\",\"2370\":\"they will drop the new steak on the floor, step on it, and then spit on it.\",\"2371\":\"you're crazy.\",\"2372\":\"then the waiter will give you a big smile as he brings you the new steak.\",\"2373\":\"where do you get these crazy ideas?\",\"2374\":\"i used to cook in a restaurant!\",\"2375\":\"but we just got here.\",\"2376\":\"did you see the waiter's hands?\",\"2377\":\"no.\",\"2378\":\"he had dirty fingernails.\",\"2379\":\"really?\",\"2380\":\"his nails were black!\",\"2381\":\"that's disgusting.\",\"2382\":\"and he poured water into our glasses.\",\"2383\":\"yuck! no water for me.\",\"2384\":\"i wonder if the cooks' nails are dirty, too.\",\"2385\":\"who cares? let's get out of here.\",\"2386\":\"i like this restaurant because they give you free bread.\",\"2387\":\"well, i think we are paying for it.\",\"2388\":\"no. look at the bill when we get it. there's no charge for the bread.\",\"2389\":\"it is delicious, especially with butter.\",\"2390\":\"i think we should just leave after we fill up on the bread.\",\"2391\":\"they probably wouldn't like that.\",\"2392\":\"i'm eating so much bread that i'm getting full.\",\"2393\":\"then stop eating the bread!\",\"2394\":\"okay, just one more piece. pass the butter, please.\",\"2395\":\"if i owned a restaurant, i would never serve hot bread before the main course.\",\"2396\":\"that's terrible. i would never go to your restaurant.\",\"2397\":\"well, the tables and chairs look okay.\",\"2398\":\"okay, let's sit down.\",\"2399\":\"check out the silverware.\",\"2400\":\"it passes inspection.\",\"2401\":\"here comes the waiter. see if his hands and nails are clean.\",\"2402\":\"well, the waiter looked clean, so i guess it's okay to eat here.\",\"2403\":\"you're forgetting about the bathroom.\",\"2404\":\"i'm going to just hope that the bathroom is clean.\",\"2405\":\"you're not going to examine it before we order dinner?\",\"2406\":\"no, i'd rather not find out that it's dirty, because i'm pretty hungry right now.\",\"2407\":\"me, too. let's forget about germs and focus on food.\",\"2408\":\"here he comes now.\",\"2409\":\"we've been sitting here for almost 10 minutes.\",\"2410\":\"oops, i guess i was wrong. that isn't our waiter.\",\"2411\":\"we can give him five more minutes, and then leave.\",\"2412\":\"i'll go up front and talk to the manager.\",\"2413\":\"that's a good idea.\",\"2414\":\"maybe they'll give us free drinks for waiting so long.\",\"2415\":\"maybe he'll send us our waiter immediately.\",\"2416\":\"every time we eat out, it's an adventure.\",\"2417\":\"last time, we got seats next to the kitchen.\",\"2418\":\"we'll never go there again.\",\"2419\":\"no, it's too close to the kitchen door.\",\"2420\":\"how about this table?\",\"2421\":\"no, it's too close to the front door.\",\"2422\":\"this looks like a nice table.\",\"2423\":\"no, it's too close to the salad bar.\",\"2424\":\"okay, i give up.\",\"2425\":\"well, there is one good table.\",\"2426\":\"great. which one?\",\"2427\":\"that one. a group of eight just sat down at it.\",\"2428\":\"what is it this time?\",\"2429\":\"an andy warhol drawing.\",\"2430\":\"he's a famous artist.\",\"2431\":\"he drew two butterflies and a flower on a napkin in a restaurant.\",\"2432\":\"did he sign it?\",\"2433\":\"yes.\",\"2434\":\"is it beautiful?\",\"2435\":\"it's just black ink on a white napkin. and the napkin has food stains!\",\"2436\":\"so it's not worth much?\",\"2437\":\"only about $30,000.\",\"2438\":\"without the food stains, it would probably be worth more.\",\"2439\":\"of course.\",\"2440\":\"i love baseball.\",\"2441\":\"so do i.\",\"2442\":\"i love to eat the peanuts.\",\"2443\":\"i love to eat the hot dogs.\",\"2444\":\"i hope we'll see a home run.\",\"2445\":\"i hope we'll catch a foul ball.\",\"2446\":\"bring a jacket.\",\"2447\":\"yes. it gets a little cool at night.\",\"2448\":\"bring a glove to catch a foul ball.\",\"2449\":\"no. i'll just use my cap to catch a foul ball.\",\"2450\":\"it certainly is.\",\"2451\":\"you hit a white ball.\",\"2452\":\"and then you chase it.\",\"2453\":\"and then you hit it again.\",\"2454\":\"finally, you put the ball into a hole in the ground.\",\"2455\":\"you do this 18 times, because there are 18 holes.\",\"2456\":\"what's the point?\",\"2457\":\"how can it be fun?\",\"2458\":\"they pay money to play this silly game!\",\"2459\":\"i think golfers have a mental problem.\",\"2460\":\"i think they're nuts.\",\"2461\":\"yes. that's a good idea.\",\"2462\":\"where do you want to go?\",\"2463\":\"we can go to the river.\",\"2464\":\"or we can go to the lake.\",\"2465\":\"or we can go to the ocean.\",\"2466\":\"let's go to the lake.\",\"2467\":\"yes. the lake is only 10 miles away.\",\"2468\":\"we can be there in 20 minutes.\",\"2469\":\"i'll get our fishing rods.\",\"2470\":\"i'll get the bait.\",\"2471\":\"we'll have fresh fish for dinner!\",\"2472\":\"i like to hit the ball.\",\"2473\":\"i like to run around the bases.\",\"2474\":\"i like to slide into the bases.\",\"2475\":\"yeah. it's a lot of fun to slide.\",\"2476\":\"i want to be a baseball player when i grow up.\",\"2477\":\"me too. i want to play for the yankees.\",\"2478\":\"not me. i want to play for the dodgers.\",\"2479\":\"we have to practice every day.\",\"2480\":\"i don't like practice.\",\"2481\":\"me neither. it's boring.\",\"2482\":\"but practice makes perfect.\",\"2483\":\"that's a good idea.\",\"2484\":\"i bought some new shoes.\",\"2485\":\"are they comfortable?\",\"2486\":\"they're very comfortable.\",\"2487\":\"how much were they?\",\"2488\":\"they were on sale for $80.\",\"2489\":\"do they help you run faster?\",\"2490\":\"no, but my feet don't hurt anymore.\",\"2491\":\"then they're worth every penny.\",\"2492\":\"you might want to buy a pair.\",\"2493\":\"i'll wait until i wear this pair out.\",\"2494\":\"you can say that again.\",\"2495\":\"but i'm worried about tiger.\",\"2496\":\"why is that?\",\"2497\":\"because he likes to scuba dive.\",\"2498\":\"what's wrong with that?\",\"2499\":\"it can be dangerous.\",\"2500\":\"you mean he could drown.\",\"2501\":\"he shouldn't scuba dive until he retires.\",\"2502\":\"but he dives to relax.\",\"2503\":\"he might relax, but it makes me nervous.\",\"2504\":\"if his wife doesn't mind, you shouldn't mind.\",\"2505\":\"the one that tiger won?\",\"2506\":\"how did he do it?\",\"2507\":\"it was nothing for him.\",\"2508\":\"he sank a 20-foot putt on the last hole to win by one stroke!\",\"2509\":\"he sank a 25-footer last year at the same tournament to win by one stroke.\",\"2510\":\"i think he is from outer space.\",\"2511\":\"no human could possibly play golf that well.\",\"2512\":\"whenever he needs a shot to win a tournament, he makes that shot.\",\"2513\":\"no human can do that.\",\"2514\":\"somebody should check his birth record.\",\"2515\":\"i bet it says he was born on mars.\",\"2516\":\"there are so many great players.\",\"2517\":\"yes, but who is the greatest?\",\"2518\":\"i'd have to say babe ruth.\",\"2519\":\"most people would say that.\",\"2520\":\"he changed the game.\",\"2521\":\"yes, he made the home run popular.\",\"2522\":\"everybody loved him, all over the nation.\",\"2523\":\"he helped make the yankees the best team ever.\",\"2524\":\"and ruth was a good person, too.\",\"2525\":\"he always visited hospitals to cheer up sick

that.\",\"2531\":\"how so?\",\"2532\":\"two guys got into an argument.\",\"2533\":\"i'll bet they were drinking.\",\"2534\":\"a third guy punched one of the two guys.\",\"2535\":\"i'll bet he was drinking, too.\",\"2536\":\"the victim hit his head on the concrete steps and died.\",\"2537\":\"that's terrible. can't people just have fun at a baseball game?\",\"2538\":\"is there a game

each.\",\"2544\":\"that's a good price.\",\"2545\":\"yes, it's cheaper than a hot dog or a beer.\",\"2546\":\"where are the seats?\",\"2547\":\"they're behind the outfield.\",\"2548\":\"maybe we can catch a home run ball.\",\"2549\":\"what's so hard about hitting a little white ball?\",\"2550\":\"it's hard if you want to do it right.\",\"2551\":\"you mean like tiger?\",\"2552\":\"no, like a good amateur golfer.\",\"2553\":\"what's so hard about golf?\",\"2554\":\"there are so many things you have to do right.\",\"2555\":\"like what?\",\"2556\":\"like keep your left arm straight, keep your head down, and follow through.\",\"2557\":\"yikes! who can remember all that?\",\"2558\":\"you need to get a lot of lessons when you're really young.\",\"2559\":\"forget it. golf sounds more like work than fun.\",\"2560\":\"the home run hitter on drugs?\",\"2561\":\"he said a doctor helped him with a personal problem.\",\"2562\":\"he said he wasn't using drugs.\",\"2563\":\"he apologized to the fans.\",\"2564\":\"the league suspended him for 50 games.\",\"2565\":\"that will cost him some money.\",\"2566\":\"yes, about $7 million.\",\"2567\":\"that will teach him a good lesson.\",\"2568\":\"he probably won't use drugs anymore.\",\"2569\":\"but it won't stop other players from using drugs.\",\"2570\":\"no. everyone always figures that they won't get caught.\",\"2571\":\"because parents don't teach their kids right from wrong.\",\"2572\":\"is that it?\",\"2573\":\"also, there aren't enough police.\",\"2574\":\"but there are a lot of police.\",\"2575\":\"there's only one police officer per 100 criminals.\",\"2576\":\"can't we hire more police?\",\"2577\":\"no. it costs too much money.\",\"2578\":\"doesn't crime cost more than police?\",\"2579\":\"yes, it does.\",\"2580\":\"so it would be cheaper to hire more police?\",\"2581\":\"yes, it would.\",\"2582\":\"yes, it is.\",\"2583\":\"people are friendly.\",\"2584\":\"yes, they are.\",\"2585\":\"the streets and sidewalks are clean.\",\"2586\":\"yes, they are.\",\"2587\":\"there's a real nice park nearby.\",\"2588\":\"yes, there is.\",\"2589\":\"i feel safe here.\",\"2590\":\"there is no crime here.\",\"2591\":\"i wish i could move here.\",\"2592\":\"maybe you can, if someone moves out.\",\"2593\":\"what happened?\",\"2594\":\"the man fell asleep.\",\"2595\":\"was he smoking?\",\"2596\":\"yes, he was smoking a cigarette.\",\"2597\":\"did he die?\",\"2598\":\"yes, he did. his cat died, too.\",\"2599\":\"that's too bad. what about his smoke alarm?\",\"2600\":\"the battery was dead.\",\"2601\":\"a good battery would have saved his life.\",\"2602\":\"he had cigarettes, but no battery.\",\"2603\":\"it happens all the time.\",\"2604\":\"he's been in jail three times already.\",\"2605\":\"why did they ever let him out?\",\"2606\":\"it's the law. they can't keep him in jail forever.\",\"2607\":\"why not? everyone knows he's a firebug. he loves to start fires.\",\"2608\":\"i don't know. sometimes the law doesn't make sense.\",\"2609\":\"but his latest fire killed someone.\",\"2610\":\"this time they have charged him with murder.\",\"2611\":\"so maybe he'll go to jail forever?\",\"2612\":\"i sure hope so.\",\"2613\":\"someone should set him on fire.\",\"2614\":\"that would teach him a good lesson.\",\"2615\":\"why?\",\"2616\":\"because it will protect you in case of an accident.\",\"2617\":\"but it's uncomfortable.\",\"2618\":\"it's the law.\",\"2619\":\"it's so much trouble.\",\"2620\":\"it's common sense.\",\"2621\":\"it's so tight that it's hard for me to breathe.\",\"2622\":\"hold your breath till we get there.\",\"2623\":\"okay, my seatbelt is on.\",\"2624\":\"i'm glad you don't complain very much.\",\"2625\":\"i'm ready for an accident.\",\"2626\":\"i'm going to change the light bulb. it burnt out.\",\"2627\":\"what are you standing

couple of feet.\",\"2633\":\"what if you fall while you're holding the light bulb, and it breaks and pieces go into your eyes?\",\"2634\":\"i never thought about that.\",\"2635\":\"you'd be blind for the rest of your life!\",\"2636\":\"i'll get the stepladder.\",\"2637\":\"yes. i called for a clean-up.\",\"2638\":\"a puddle of water is very dangerous.\",\"2639\":\"it isn't easy to

outside for a fireman to tell us to go back in.\",\"2659\":\"why? we're already late.\",\"2660\":\"i have to check the stove.\",\"2661\":\"what's the matter?\",\"2662\":\"maybe i left the burner on.\",\"2663\":\"no, you didn't. i checked the stove before we left.\",\"2664\":\"are you sure?\",\"2665\":\"of course i'm sure.\",\"2666\":\"well, i have to go back upstairs anyway.\",\"2667\":\"it's

on first.\",\"3164\":\"thank you.\",\"3165\":\"i hope they fit.\",\"3166\":\"i hope you kept the receipt.\",\"3167\":\"you think they won't fit?\",\"3168\":\"i think i've put on some weight.\",\"3169\":\"you think?\",\"3170\":\"maybe a pound or two.\",\"3171\":\"maybe four or five pounds?\",\"3172\":\"my waist is bigger than it was.\",\"3173\":\"no problem. these pants have an elastic waistband.\",\"3174\":\"you are so smart!\",\"3175\":\"let me look at our list.\",\"3176\":\"i know that we need milk.\",\"3177\":\"nonfat.\",\"3178\":\"of course. what else?\",\"3179\":\"we need cheese, bread, and ham.\",\"3180\":\"what kind of cheese?\",\"3181\":\"swiss.\",\"3182\":\"of course, the cheese with holes in it.\",\"3183\":\"i never used to buy swiss cheese.\",\"3184\":\"why not?\",\"3185\":\"i didn't want to pay for the holes.\",\"3186\":\"i thought you just bought a pair.\",\"3187\":\"i did.\",\"3188\":\"what's wrong with them so soon?\",\"3189\":\"the pants are fine, but the pocket has a huge hole in it.\",\"3190\":\"you shouldn't carry your keys and pens in your pocket.\",\"3191\":\"but that's what pockets are for.\",\"3192\":\"you should carry them in a purse.\",\"3193\":\"i'm a man, and men don't carry purses!\",\"3194\":\"well, you should buy pants with stronger pockets.\",\"3195\":\"i would if i could find someone who makes strong pockets.\",\"3196\":\"try a google search online.\",\"3197\":\"you use them to wipe the handle of the shopping cart.\",\"3198\":\"that's a great idea.\",\"3199\":\"yes, all the markets just started offering wipes to shoppers.\",\"3200\":\"i'm going to take five wipes.\",\"3201\":\"what do you need five of them for?\",\"3202\":\"one to wipe the handle, and the others to wipe the produce.\",\"3203\":\"what's the matter with the produce?\",\"3204\":\"do you think the bananas fell from the sky?\",\"3205\":\"what do you mean?\",\"3206\":\"i mean, someone used their dirty hands to pick the bananas, the apples, and the oranges.\",\"3207\":\"well, you better save a wipe for the dirty dollar bills you're going to pay with.\",\"3208\":\"yes, i did.\",\"3209\":\"what did you buy?\",\"3210\":\"well, i got a lot of good deals, as usual.\",\"3211\":\"like what?\",\"3212\":\"well, a dozen large eggs were only 99 cents.\",\"3213\":\"that's a good deal.\",\"3214\":\"and a one-pound tub of soft butter was the same price.\",\"3215\":\"another good deal.\",\"3216\":\"but the best deal was five pounds of potatoes for 99 cents.\",\"3217\":\"i don't know how that store makes money.\",\"3218\":\"neither do i, but they're doing something right.\",\"3219\":\"what's the matter with yours?\",\"3220\":\"it's six years old.\",\"3221\":\"that's pretty old.\",\"3222\":\"it still works, but i'm going to give it to a charity.\",\"3223\":\"are you going to buy a desktop or laptop?\",\"3224\":\"oh, a laptop, of course.\",\"3225\":\"a pc or a mac?\",\"3226\":\"i haven't decided yet.\",\"3227\":\"more and more people are using macs.\",\"3228\":\"but 90 percent of the world uses pcs.\",\"3229\":\"and that's not going to change anytime soon.\",\"3230\":\"what happened?\",\"3231\":\"i had a car problem, so i went online.\",\"3232\":\"did you find a solution?\",\"3233\":\"yes, i did. a site i went to said they would send me the solution.\",\"3234\":\"so, what's the problem?\",\"3235\":\"i sent them $20 using my credit card, but they never sent me the solution.\",\"3236\":\"what are you going to do?\",\"3237\":\"i sent them an email asking for my money back.\",\"3238\":\"have you heard from them?\",\"3239\":\"not yet. it's been a week.\",\"3240\":\"well, i guess that's a $20 lesson for you.\",\"3241\":\"which one?\",\"3242\":\"any one. i need to sharpen this pencil.\",\"3243\":\"i think there's one on the dining room table.\",\"3244\":\"i already looked there.\",\"3245\":\"did you look in the desk drawer?\",\"3246\":\"yes, i looked there, too.\",\"3247\":\"don't we have about five sharpeners?\",\"3248\":\"yes, but they seem to have legs.\",\"3249\":\"tomorrow i'm going to buy an electric sharpener.\",\"3250\":\"get one with the rubber suction cups on the bottom.\",\"3251\":\"yes. that way it will stay where i put it.\",\"3252\":\"how are you doing that?\",\"3253\":\"i started shopping at the dollar store.\",\"3254\":\"that saves a lot of money.\",\"3255\":\"i bought three pounds of potatoes for a dollar.\",\"3256\":\"that's a good deal.\",\"3257\":\"yes, even though some of the potatoes had eyes.\",\"3258\":\"just put them in the fridge.\",\"3259\":\"also, i bought a can of cheap coffee and a bag of good coffee.\",\"3260\":\"why did you do that?\",\"3261\":\"i mixed them together.\",\"3262\":\"if the coffee still tastes okay, that's a good idea.\",\"3263\":\"can we afford it?\",\"3264\":\"they want 20 percent down.\",\"3265\":\"that's a lot of money.\",\"3266\":\"but the house is so nice.\",\"3267\":\"it's in a great neighborhood.\",\"3268\":\"it's close to the beach.\",\"3269\":\"it's close to the freeways.\",\"3270\":\"it's got a big yard.\",\"3271\":\"the kids love the house, too.\",\"3272\":\"if we don't buy it, someone else will.\",\"3273\":\"you're right. let's buy it now. we can worry later.\",\"3274\":\"are you sure?\",\"3275\":\"we will be house rich, but cash poor.\",\"3276\":\"what do you mean?\",\"3277\":\"our monthly payments will be too high.\",\"3278\":\"we won't have any money for other things?\",\"3279\":\"no, we won't have money for gas or food.\",\"3280\":\"we'll be eating peanut butter sandwiches?\",\"3281\":\"without the peanut butter!\",\"3282\":\"that's no good!\",\"3283\":\"we have to find a cheaper house.\",\"3284\":\"of course. we can't live without gas or peanut butter.\",\"3285\":\"i don't like it.\",\"3286\":\"what's the matter with it?\",\"3287\":\"it's on the corner.\",\"3288\":\"so?\",\"3289\":\"that means it gets twice as much traffic.\",\"3290\":\"you're right.\",\"3291\":\"when you're inside, you will always hear cars stopping and stopping at the intersection.\",\"3292\":\"or you'll hear the collision if someone doesn't stop.\",\"3293\":\"or you'll see the collision if they crash into the house.\",\"3294\":\"let's find a house that's at the end of a dead end.\",\"3295\":\"that's perfect. the less traffic, the better.\",\"3296\":\"me, too.\",\"3297\":\"we have a 2 o'clock appointment to see the one on main street.\",\"3298\":\"we'd better get ready to go.\",\"3299\":\"it's an upstairs unit.\",\"3300\":\"that's good, because i don't want to live under people with loud feet.\",\"3301\":\"and it's a corner unit.\",\"3302\":\"that's great. we won't have neighbors on both sides of us.\",\"3303\":\"no pets are allowed.\",\"3304\":\"perfect. we don't have to listen to barking dogs.\",\"3305\":\"and there are only six units in the whole building.\",\"3306\":\"where's the checkbook? i'm ready to rent it without even seeing it.\",\"3307\":\"yes. he said he'd come over tomorrow.\",\"3308\":\"did he say what time?\",\"3309\":\"yes. he said he'd be here at 9 o'clock.\",\"3310\":\"did he understand what the problem is?\",\"3311\":\"yes. i told him our doorbell doesn't work.\",\"3312\":\"it shouldn't take him long to fix it.\",\"3313\":\"i don't even know why we need to fix it.\",\"3314\":\"in case we have visitors.\",\"3315\":\"but they can just knock on the door.\",\"3316\":\"actually, i want him to look at our carpet, too.\",\"3317\":\"yes, it would be nice if he'd give us a new carpet.\",\"3318\":\"yes, it's beautiful.\",\"3319\":\"it's perfect for us and the kids.\",\"3320\":\"three bedrooms, three bathrooms, and a big back yard.\",\"3321\":\"and we can afford it!\",\"3322\":\"so are we going to buy it?\",\"3323\":\"i'm afraid not.\",\"3324\":\"it's too far from your job, isn't it?\",\"3325\":\"i can't spend four hours on the road every day.\",\"3326\":\"by the time you get home, you'll be too tired to even eat.\",\"3327\":\"i won't be able to play with the kids.\",\"3328\":\"no, we have to find something closer to your job.\",\"3329\":\"it sure is.\",\"3330\":\"in fact, it's chilly in the apartment, too.\",\"3331\":\"let's turn on the heat.\",\"3332\":\"i'll check to make sure that all the windows are shut.\",\"3333\":\"it should be warmer in a few minutes.\",\"3334\":\"it's so nice to have a heated apartment.\",\"3335\":\"how did they survive in the old days?\",\"3336\":\"they had fireplaces.\",\"3337\":\"someone had to chop the wood.\",\"3338\":\"and carry it into the house.\",\"3339\":\"all we have to do is flip a switch.\",\"3340\":\"the streets are clean and quiet.\",\"3341\":\"the neighbors don't party on the weekends.\",\"3342\":\"people take care of their lawns.\",\"3343\":\"no rusty old cars are sitting in the front yards.\",\"3344\":\"we never have to call the police about anything.\",\"3345\":\"our kids are completely safe.\",\"3346\":\"so why are we selling our house?\",\"3347\":\"they're building a 3-story apartment building on the corner.\",\"3348\":\"so we've got to sell before property values go down?\",\"3349\":\"yes. i still can't believe our city council allowed this building.\",\"3350\":\"they're probably getting something under the table.\",\"3351\":\"yes, it was.\",\"3352\":\"they said about 30 houses burned to the ground.\",\"3353\":\"and they were expensive houses.\",\"3354\":\"i feel so sorry for those people.\",\"3355\":\"why feel sorry for rich people?\",\"3356\":\"i feel sorry for anyone who loses their home.\",\"3357\":\"so do i, but not if they're rich.\",\"3358\":\"what does that have to do with it?\",\"3359\":\"rich people think they're better than us.\",\"3360\":\"how many rich people do you know?\",\"3361\":\"none.\",\"3362\":\"of course they are. they're starving to death.\",\"3363\":\"they should stay in the woods where they belong.\",\"3364\":\"there's no food in the woods.\",\"3365\":\"can't they eat grass?\",\"3366\":\"do you think a bear is a cow?\",\"3367\":\"well, i've seen them eating berries.\",\"3368\":\"berries aren't in season all year round.\",\"3369\":\"it's too dangerous for kids and pets.\",\"3370\":\"people need to cover their trash cans.\",\"3371\":\"the police need to shoot all the bears.\",\"3372\":\"you don't solve a problem by shooting it.\",\"3373\":\"i voted for obama.\",\"3374\":\"me too.\",\"3375\":\"he will be a great president.\",\"3376\":\"everyone likes him.\",\"3377\":\"he's a good speaker.\",\"3378\":\"and he's really smart.\",\"3379\":\"he will solve our problems.\",\"3380\":\"he will end the war.\",\"3381\":\"the next four years will be good years.\",\"3382\":\"i'll vote for him next time, too.\",\"3383\":\"i think everyone will.\",\"3384\":\"who are you voting for?\",\"3385\":\"i'm not voting for the mayor.\",\"3386\":\"why not?\",\"3387\":\"he made promises that he didn't keep.\",\"3388\":\"like what?\",\"3389\":\"he promised to hire 1,000 more police officers.\",\"3390\":\"how many did he hire?\",\"3391\":\"one hundred!\",\"3392\":\"maybe he had a good reason.\",\"3393\":\"maybe he's just a liar.\",\"3394\":\"maybe i'll vote for someone else, too.\",\"3395\":\"only 15 percent of the voters turned out.\",\"3396\":\"that is a joke.\",\"3397\":\"voting is so important, but people don't bother.\",\"3398\":\"many people think their vote doesn't matter.\",\"3399\":\"the mayor won by only 2,000 votes.\",\"3400\":\"we're stuck with him for four more years.\",\"3401\":\"voting is so easy. you can even mail your ballot in.\",\"3402\":\"all you have to do is vote and put a stamp on it.\",\"3403\":\"how easy is that?\",\"3404\":\"i guess people just don't care.\",\"3405\":\"they'll care when they see their taxes go up.\",\"3406\":\"but we have the same old problems.\",\"3407\":\"well, he's made a few changes.\",\"3408\":\"like what?\",\"3409\":\"i think he closed the bowling alley in the white house.\",\"3410\":\"oh, yeah. he's changing it to a basketball court.\",\"3411\":\"who's paying for that?\",\"3412\":\"i think we are!\",\"3413\":\"well, that's okay, as long as it helps him relax and think more clearly.\",\"3414\":\"yes, we need a relaxed president who thinks clearly.\",\"3415\":\"do any other world leaders have a basketball court?\",\"3416\":\"they will. you know america always leads the way.\",\"3417\":\"well, more than 50 million people voted for mccain.\",\"3418\":\"that's 50 million people who don't love obama.\",\"3419\":\"obama's got four years to make everyone happy.\",\"3420\":\"he's never going to make everyone happy.\",\"3421\":\"can you imagine being president?\",\"3422\":\"everyone wants you to solve their problems.\",\"3423\":\"i have enough stress from trying to solve my own problems.\",\"3424\":\"you and everybody else.\",\"3425\":\"i would never want to be president.\",\"3426\":\"but think about all the power you'd have.\",\"3427\":\"i prefer my quiet little life to all the power in the world.\",\"3428\":\"what article?\",\"3429\":\"it says the mayor spends only 11 percent of his time on city duties.\",\"3430\":\"only 11 percent?\",\"3431\":\"about 50 percent of the time he's traveling.\",\"3432\":\"where does he travel to?\",\"3433\":\"oh, all over the world.\",\"3434\":\"but he's supposed to be making our city a better place.\",\"3435\":\"he's visiting other cities to get ideas.\",\"3436\":\"can't he just go online?\",\"3437\":\"the rest of the time he's raising money for his reelection.\",\"3438\":\"well, he'll never get reelected once this news gets out.\",\"3439\":\"i voted for ralph nader.\",\"3440\":\"who in the world is ralph nader?\",\"3441\":\"he's the best man for president.\",\"3442\":\"why's that?\",\"3443\":\"he hates corporations.\",\"3444\":\"well, most corporations do think only about money.\",\"3445\":\"he hates democrats and republicans.\",\"3446\":\"well, they do put their party before their country.\",\"3447\":\"he's the only candidate that i trust.\",\"3448\":\"but he didn't have a chance. nobody voted for him!\",\"3449\":\"sooner or later, voters will wake up.\",\"3450\":\"why's that?\",\"3451\":\"what good does it do?\",\"3452\":\"you get to put someone in power that you like.\",\"3453\":\"only if my candidate wins.\",\"3454\":\"well, he can't win unless you and others vote for him.\",\"3455\":\"but even if my candidate wins, he'll break his promises.\",\"3456\":\"that's true. they promise anything just so they get elected.\",\"3457\":\"and when elected, they go their own way.\",\"3458\":\"they forget who put them in power.\",\"3459\":\"they forget where they came from.\",\"3460\":\"maybe you should run for office.\",\"3461\":\"what do you mean?\",\"3462\":\"there were more votes than voters!\",\"3463\":\"but that's impossible.\",\"3464\":\"officials said that it's possible.\",\"3465\":\"did they explain how it's possible?\",\"3466\":\"no. they said there are some things you can't explain.\",\"3467\":\"so are they going to hold another election?\",\"3468\":\"no. that will cost too much money.\",\"3469\":\"so it's better to save money than to have an honest election?\",\"3470\":\"well, the democratic party says it was an honest election.\",\"3471\":\"of course they say that\\u00c2\\u2014their man won!\",\"3472\":\"yes. he's telling jokes about his eight years as president.\",\"3473\":\"yes, those eight years were a lot of fun for everyone.\",\"3474\":\"only 4,000 american soldiers were killed overseas.\",\"3475\":\"not to mention 40,000 wounded soldiers.\",\"3476\":\"but bush visited some of them in the hospital once.\",\"3477\":\"that's nice that he found the time to make a visit.\",\"3478\":\"he spoke to them and made them feel better.\",\"3479\":\"did he speak to every family that lost a soldier?\",\"3480\":\"no, he didn't have time to do that.\",\"3481\":\"well, he's got plenty of time now!\",\"3482\":\"no, he's too busy writing a book about how hard it was to be president.\",\"3483\":\"yes, with the voter instructions.\",\"3484\":\"how are you going to vote?\",\"3485\":\"same as ever, by mail. all it costs me is a 42-cent stamp.\",\"3486\":\"i meant, are you going to vote for or against the new taxes?\",\"3487\":\"against all of them, of course.\",\"3488\":\"but we need new taxes to pay for highways, schools, and prisons.\",\"3489\":\"we've already voted for new taxes to pay for all that stuff!\",\"3490\":\"that's true. where did that money go?\",\"3491\":\"our legislators spent it on first-class travel all over the world.\",\"3492\":\"they are having a good time with our money.\",\"3493\":\"so when are we going to stop giving them more?\",\"3494\":\"do you mean on measures 1, 2, and 3?\",\"3495\":\"yes. the ones that will improve our schools, roads, and hospitals.\",\"3496\":\"you mean the measures that will raise our taxes.\",\"3497\":\"but the tv ads say that our taxes will not increase.\",\"3498\":\"do you believe the tv ads?\",\"3499\":\"i like the one where the fireman tells us why we should vote yes.\",\"3500\":\"don't believe him! whatever the tv ads tell you, the opposite is true.\",\"3501\":\"but the title of measure 1 is \\\"better schools at no cost.\\\"\",\"3502\":\"the title should be \\\"better schools at huge cost.\\\"\",\"3503\":\"i can't believe that they would lie to us.\",\"3504\":\"of course they lie\\u00c2\\u2014that's what politicians do!\",\"3505\":\"is it something you ate?\",\"3506\":\"maybe. i'm not sure.\",\"3507\":\"what did you have for breakfast?\",\"3508\":\"the usual, cereal with milk and a banana.\",\"3509\":\"maybe the milk was bad.\",\"3510\":\"it didn't smell bad.\",\"3511\":\"maybe the banana was bad.\",\"3512\":\"no, the banana was delicious.\",\"3513\":\"maybe you just need to go to the bathroom.\",\"3514\":\"no, that's not the problem.\",\"3515\":\"maybe it will go away in a little while.\",\"3516\":\"i don't know.\",\"3517\":\"it looks like blood.\",\"3518\":\"i think my nose was bleeding.\",\"3519\":\"you should wet your shirt immediately.\",\"3520\":\"why?\",\"3521\":\"because that gets the blood out of the shirt.\",\"3522\":\"what's a little blood?\",\"3523\":\"your white shirt is ruined.\",\"3524\":\"so, i'll just buy another one.\",\"3525\":\"you can wear this one around the house.\",\"3526\":\"next time i'll soak it immediately.\",\"3527\":\"why do they hurt?\",\"3528\":\"i type too much.\",\"3529\":\"you should take a break.\",\"3530\":\"i need to type to make money.\",\"3531\":\"but typing is causing you pain.\",\"3532\":\"maybe i should see a doctor.\",\"3533\":\"doctors are too expensive.\",\"3534\":\"he might tell me to rest for a while.\",\"3535\":\"he might want to cut you open.\",\"3536\":\"he might say i'm okay.\",\"3537\":\"he might say you have bone cancer.\",\"3538\":\"he thinks i have too much stress.\",\"3539\":\"stress causes your stomachaches?\",\"3540\":\"stress causes different problems with different people.\",\"3541\":\"so what did he tell you to do?\",\"3542\":\"he said i need to think positive.\",\"3543\":\"he didn't give you any medication?\",\"3544\":\"i hate medication. it makes me feel different.\",\"3545\":\"so how do you think positive?\",\"3546\":\"i think about nice things.\",\"3547\":\"like what?\",\"3548\":\"like a day at the beach, with my toes in the sand.\",\"3549\":\"how did you do that?\",\"3550\":\"it's a paper cut.\",\"3551\":\"paper can be dangerous.\",\"3552\":\"it hurts, too.\",\"3553\":\"paper cuts can hurt a lot.\",\"3554\":\"where are the band-aids?\",\"3555\":\"i think they're in the medicine cabinet.\",\"3556\":\"it's on the tip of my finger.\",\"3557\":\"a band-aid might not work.\",\"3558\":\"i must not use this finger until the cut heals.\",\"3559\":\"it might take a day or two to heal.\",\"3560\":\"oh, yes.\",\"3561\":\"i can't stand cigarette
